* Dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles so that I can more easily manage various
programs that I use regularly across machines. This repository is intended to be
used with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]. There are certainly dedicated dotfile managers that also use
this directory structure, but I wouldn't know anything about that.

I keep my Emacs config in a [[https://github.com/4ffy/emacs-config][separate repository]].
